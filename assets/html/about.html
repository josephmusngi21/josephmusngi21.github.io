            Hello! My name is Joseph Musngi, a Computer Science Student at The
            University of Arizona with a passion for Front End, but also willing
            to learn more and get better at Back End.
          </p>
          <p>-----------------------------------</p>
          <p>
            I'm currently pursing my Bachelor's degree in Computer Science,
            where I have taken courses in Data Structures, Algorithms and Full
            Stack Development.
          </p>
          <p>-----------------------------------</p>
          <p>
            I have a great understanding of Python, JavaScript, HTML, CSS, C#,
            while also having basic knowledge of languages such as Java, SQL, C
            and C++.
          </p>
          <p>-----------------------------------</p>
          <p>
            I also have a great understanding of many data structures such as
            Linked Lists, Trees, Arrays, Stacks, Queues, Hash Tables, Sets and
            eager to learn more.
          </p>
          <p>-----------------------------------</p>
          <p>
            In the future, I would like to work either Full Stack or a Data
            Scientist in the tech industry.
          </p>
          <p>-----------------------------------</p>
          <p>
            Outside of coding, I enjoy climbing, hiking, tennis and going
            bowling with friends
